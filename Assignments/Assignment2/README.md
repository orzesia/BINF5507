Assignment 2 - Regression and Classification Models

The goal is to train, evaluate, and compare regression and classification models using the UCI Heart Disease dataset.

All data, including the original file, cleaned data, and result spreadsheets, are in the data folder.
All scripts are in the scripts folder.

How to use:
1. Take a deep breath. You're doing great.
2. Open main.ipynb in Jupyter from Scripts folder
3. Run the notebook from start to finish (don't skip cells unless you enjoy debugging).
4. Review the output. Or believe my word when I say it works.

Enjoy!
