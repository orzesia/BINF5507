Assignment 1 - data preprocessing

Folders:
Data - has all the csv files from each stage of data preprocessing
Scripts - data_preprocessor.py - has defined all the functions and a simple model
        - main.ipynb - notebook with all the explainations and code
        - main.py - just code. but it works.

How to run the code: from the notebook ideally one cell at a time, no skipping as they feed to each other. If all hope is lost, from main.py, just make sure to un-comment all the parts you're interested in.
