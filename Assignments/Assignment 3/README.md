## Clustering Algorithm Self-Study - DBSCAN – Assignment 3

This repository contains the code, report, and figures for the DBSCAN-focused clustering algorithm assignment.


### Content

- `assignment report.pdf` – Final report with DBSCAN overview, comparative analysis, updated table, and all required figures.
- `scripts/` – Python script or Jupyter notebook or both used for clustering and visualization.
  - `scripts/ main.ipynb` -  has some explanations
  - `scripts/ algotithm_comparison.py` - the code with minimal notes
- `figures/` – Plots showing results from DBSCAN, k-Means, and Hierarchical clustering on various datasets.
- `README.md` – You’re reading it.

### Datasets Used

All datasets were generated using `sklearn.datasets`:

- `make_moons` – Irregular shapes, great for DBSCAN
- `make_blobs` – Varying densities, to make DBSCAN sweat a little
- `make_circles` – Circles in circles (sadly not in circles)
